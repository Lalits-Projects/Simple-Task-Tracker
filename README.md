# Simple Task Tracker
Minimal Task-Tracker. Easy to Use and Distraction Free. Made for Only One Thing!

## How to Use
The system is very simple with only two windows the user can interact with. When the program is launched a small window would apear with two text input fields. The first is the time field which would hold the time frame the user intends to spend on a task. The task is then added in the window underneath.

Too ensure this set of task and time is added to the final list, the user must press 'Add Task'. If this was done successfuly the text they entered would be cleared and be ready for the next task.

Once the user has added the last time and time, they press 'Finish Task' to close this window and generate the next window. The generated To-Do list looks like this!

The new window is the main To-Do list. As simplicity was a key aspect of this programs design the user can only mark a task allocated by double pressing on the row they have completed. You can see this below.

As seen above this will place a strike-out line through the task and time texts. If the user marked a task as completed by accident, they can undo this bu double clicking the same row. 


## And thats it!
I hope you guys enjoy the tacker, I found myself using it quite a lot just because of how it small and neat it is (but i guess im biased..) Anyway, let me know what you guys think, what works well and what needs improving! Thanks!
